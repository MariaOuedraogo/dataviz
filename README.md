Introduction:
<br>

Human trafficking is a global problem that demands attention and action. This README aims to shed light on the complexities of human trafficking from 2002 to 2019, exploring its different forms, the individuals involved and the societal impact. We examine the influence of popular culture on the glamorization of the crime, the false promises that lead to human trafficking, the main networks and names associated with the problem, and the correlation between a country's situation and the prevalence of human trafficking.
